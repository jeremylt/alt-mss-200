Assignment
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Two ways to learn about the Navajo Code Talkers are given above.
The 2002 movie Windtalkers is `one of the most inaccurate military movies <https://screenrant.com/war-movies-experts-criticized-military-mistakes/>`_ and should not be consulted as a source.
Select at least one of the sources given above, or an alternative source.
If you are unfamiliar with the Code Talkers, consider reading the Wikipedia article given above before watching the documentary.
On the social media platform of your choice, make a post or series of posts answering the following questions:

1. What are your overall impressions from the stories?
What sticks with you the most strongly?

2. The initial reluctance of several of the Code Talkers to return to battlefields in the documentary highlights an important issue.
Discuss the importance of understanding and adapting to cultural practices and religious beliefs for people you're supporting.

3. A common theme in the personal stories of the Code Talkers is the hardships they faced growing up due to the actions of the U.S. government.
Discuss what it might feel like for you to sign up to serve in the U.S. military after growing up with the sort of adversity faced by the Code Talkers and given the history between indigenous people and the U.S. military.

Bonus: It is rather difficult to locate resources on the contributions of indigenous people, even when compared to other systemically marginalized groups.
The video resource for this lesson was a documentary instead of a major motion picture, for example.
Investigate this issue.
